Presentations gave by me.

They are written in markdown using:

- [revealmd](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md)
- [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/)

To run it locally, clone the repo or the directory of one presentation and run for example:

```console
docker run --rm -p 1948:1948 -v :meetup_nl_20200617_starting/slides webpronl/reveal-md:latest
```

Later on, you can check it by opening in a browsing going to:

```console
http://localhost:1948/meetup_nl_we_start_on_the_journey.md#/
```
